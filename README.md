# Social Investing, Safely

## Challenge

It's hard to get started with crypto investments. 
1. There's no safe way to do it.
2. It's scary to do it alone.
3. It's difficult to understand.


## What We Built

THISAPP is a social investment app that enables you to invest in crypto with your risk tolerance in mind. No longer are you alone in the venture; with THISAPP, you can see where people are putting their money.


## Features

* Experience community: See who else is investing in the same group, and contribute to their pot.
* Invest with safeguards: The smart contracts backend takes you out of an investment before it becomes too risky.
* Create a new investment group: Our proprietary algorithm matches you to people with a complementary investment strategy. 
* Choose your risk tolerance: 
 * üê† Want to dabble in cryptocurrency without a huge loss? Use the Safe strategy. 
 * üêã Like to live dangerously? Try for a high risk, high reward Gain strategy.


## Next Steps

We're planning to further build out a feature that allows socially conscious investors to donate a portion of their capital gains to vetted organizations.
